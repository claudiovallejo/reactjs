## Learning React.js
a first dive into building Web Applications

I'll be using Stoyan Stefanov's _React Up & Running: Building Web Applications_ as an introduction to building web applications with JavaScript and will be sharing notes and project exercises as I work through the textbook.

What excites me the most about learning to use React is summed up by Facebook's vision for React:

"... instead we want to chase the _learn once, write anywhere_ paradigm... We want to be able to develop a consistent set of tools and technologies that let us build applications using the same set of principles across whatever platform we want. What this means is that a set of engineers can build an iOS app and turn around the next day and build the exact same app in Android just by virtue of knowing React."
